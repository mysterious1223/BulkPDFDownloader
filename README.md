# BulkPDFDownloader
Download PDF files in Bulk



How does it work?

First paste all URL's into the file names urls.txt - each line will be represented as one file.


Create a folder called PDFs


Finally run program.
It will download each url and save into your PDFs folder. Feel free to modify to rename each saved PDF.

I will create a version with a GUI soon.
